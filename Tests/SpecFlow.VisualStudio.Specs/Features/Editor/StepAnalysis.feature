Feature: Step analysis

Rules:

* Highlight defined/undefined steps
	* Highlights defined/undefined steps
	* Highlights step parameters
	* Analyses all examples of scenario outline
* Show step definition errors
	* The step definition has invalid parameter count
	* Ambiguous step definitions
* Handle scopes
	* Matches scoped step definitions
	* Analyses all scopes of background steps
* Refresh analysis after build
	* Step is just defined and the project is built

Result Variations:
* Match
	* Matching step => jump
		* Unscoped
        * DataTable&DocString => select overload based on param type
		* Scoped
		* Unscoped&Scoped => use scoped or unscoped depending on contex (no ambiguity)
        * SO, but mathces to the same stepdef
	* Binding errors (e.g. parameter count) => err,jump
	* OUT: Parameter error (e.g. invalid conversion)
	* OUT: Same method matches multiple ways
* Undefined
	* No candidating step definitions => undef
	* OUT: Some match, but with different type => error (now: undef)
	* OUT: Some match, but with different scope => error (now: undef)
    * SO, but all (incl. empty) undefined => undef
* Ambiguous
	* Multiple matching step => err,list
	* Multiple step, some with binding/parameter errors => err,list
    * SO, but all ambiguous => err,list (of merged candidates)
* Multi-match (SO, Background)
	* All match => list
	* Some with binding/parameter errors => err,list
	* Some undefined => undef,list incl. generate step def
	* Some ambiguous => err,list
