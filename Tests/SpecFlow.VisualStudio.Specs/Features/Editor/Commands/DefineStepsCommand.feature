Feature: Define steps command

Rules:

* Lists all undefined steps
  * There are undefined steps
  * Two undefined step has the same step definition skeleton
* Shows error when all steps defined
  * All steps are defined
* Selected step definition skeletons can be copied to clipboard
  * Selected step definition skeletons are copied to clipboard
* Selected step definitions skeletons can be saved to a new file
  * Selected step definition skeletons are saved to a new file
  * Selected step definition skeletons are saved to a new file in StepDefinitions folder

Scenario: There are undefined steps
	Given there is a SpecFlow project scope
	And the following step definitions in the project:
		| type  | regex                          |
		| Given | the operands have been entered |
	And the following feature file in the editor
		"""
		Feature: Addition

		Scenario: Add two numbers
			Given the operands have been entered
			When I press multiply
			Then the result is calculated
		"""
	And the initial binding discovery is performed
	When I invoke the "Define Steps" command
	Then the define steps dialog should be opened with the following step definition skeletons
		| type | expression               |
		| When | I press multiply         |
		| Then | the result is calculated |
