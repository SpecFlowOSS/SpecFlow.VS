Feature: Find step definition usages command

Rules:
* List usages of a step definition and allows jumping to the usage
	* Finds usages of a step definition with a few usage
	* Finds usage of a step definition with a single usage
* Detects and report unused step definition
	* The step definition is not used
* Manual: Offers to show usages in the search window

Scenario: Finds usage of a step definition with a single usage
	Given there is a SpecFlow project scope
	And the following feature file "Addition.feature"
